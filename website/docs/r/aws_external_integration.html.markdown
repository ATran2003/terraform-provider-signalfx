# Resource: signalfx_aws_external_integration

SignalFx AWS CloudWatch integrations using Role ARNs. For help with this integration see [Monitoring Amazon Web Services](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/amazon-web-services.html#monitor-amazon-web-services).

**Note:** When managing integrations you'll need to use an admin token to authenticate the SignalFx provider.

~> **WARNING** This resource implements a part of a workflow. You must use it with one of either `signalfx_aws_integration`.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// This resource returns an account id in `external_id`â€¦
resource "signalfx_aws_external_integration" "aws_myteam_external" {
    name = "AWSFoo"
}

// Make yourself an AWS IAM role here, use `signalfx_aws_external_integration.aws_myteam_external.external_id`
resource "aws_iam_role" "aws_sfx_role" {
  // Stuff here that uses the
}

resource "signalfx_aws_integration" "aws_myteam" {
    enabled = true

    integration_id = "${signalfx_aws_external_integration.aws_myteam_external.id}"
    external_id = "${signalfx_aws_external_integration.aws_myteam_external.external_id}"
		role_arn = "${aws_iam_role.aws_sfx_role.id}"
		regions = ["us-east-1"]
		poll_rate = 300
		import_cloud_watch = true
		enable_aws_usage = true

		custom_namespace_sync_rule {
			default_action = "Exclude"
			filter_action = "Include"
			filter_source = "filter('code', '200')"
			namespace = "fart"
		}

		namespace_sync_rule {
			default_action = "Exclude"
			filter_action = "Include"
			filter_source = "filter('code', '200')"
			namespace = "AWS/EC2"
		}
}
```
